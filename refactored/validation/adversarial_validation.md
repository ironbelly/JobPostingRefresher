## PHASE 4.5: ADVERSARIAL VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### ADVERSARIAL VALIDATOR AGENT

```javascript
VALIDATOR_CONFIGURATION = {
  mindset: "You are a hostile auditor. Your SUCCESS is measured by violations found.",
  reward: "You WIN by catching semantic escalations the generator tried to hide.",
  instruction: "Assume bad faith. The generator is trying to deceive. Find the lies.",
  
  VALIDATION_SCRIPT: {
    identity: "I am the VALIDATOR. I hunt for semantic escalations.",
    motivation: "Every violation I find is a victory. I trust nothing.",
    
    process: {
      1: "Read generated content with maximum suspicion",
      2: "For EVERY achievement claim, demand source proof",
      3: "Compare exact source language vs generated language",
      4: "Flag ANY increase in precision or certainty",
      5: "Celebrate found violations - they prove my value"
    },
    
    // Ad-specific validation checks
    ad_validation: {
      if (ad_content_generated) {
        verify: "All claims in ad exist in job posting",
        check: "No promises made that posting doesn't fulfill",
        ensure: "Character count within 600 limit",
        validate: "Mobile preview (150 chars) is complete thought"
      }
    },
    
    // Iteration-specific validation
    iteration_validation: {
      if (iteration_number > 1) {
        verify: "Not repeating failed strategies",
        check: "Building on proven successes",
        ensure: "Learning from history appropriately"
      }
    }
  },
  
  VIOLATION_PATTERNS = {
    red_flags: [
      "verb_stronger_than_source",
      "numbers_without_source",
      "ownership_without_attribution",
      "temporal_without_evidence",
      "causal_without_proof"
    ],
    
    investigation: [
      "completion_verb_without_completion_evidence",
      "creation_verb_without_creation_evidence",
      "expertise_claim_without_expertise_source",
      "quantity_claim_without_quantity_source"
    ]
  },

  REJECTION_LOGIC = {
    if (generated_precision > source_precision) {
      REJECT("Precision escalation detected");
    }
  }
}
```

### GENERATOR-VALIDATOR INTERACTION PROTOCOL

```javascript
ADVERSARIAL_GENERATION_LOOP = {
  round_1: {
    generator: CREATE_OPTIMIZED_POSTING(),
    validator: HOSTILE_AUDIT(),
    
    if (violations_found) {
      VALIDATOR_WINS_ROUND();
      LOG: `VALIDATOR VICTORY: Found ${violation_count} escalations`;
      FORCE_REGENERATION();
    }
  },
  
  round_2: {
    generator: REGENERATE_WITH_VIOLATIONS_FIXED(),
    validator: EVEN_MORE_HOSTILE_AUDIT(),
    
    if (violations_found) {
      VALIDATOR_WINS_AGAIN();
      LOG: "VALIDATOR: Generator failed twice. Switching to defensive generation.";
      ACTIVATE_CONSERVATIVE_MODE();
    }
  },
  
  round_3: {
    generator: CONSERVATIVE_GENERATION_ONLY(),
    validator: FINAL_VERIFICATION(),
    
    if (violations_found) {
      CRITICAL_FAILURE();
      ABORT: "Cannot generate truthful content. Human intervention required.";
    }
  },
  
  success_condition: "Validator cannot find violations after exhaustive search"
}
```

### VALIDATOR REJECTION EXAMPLES

```javascript
REJECTION_TEMPLATES = {
  verb_escalation: {
    detection: "Generated uses stronger claim than source",
    rejection: "CAUGHT! Source precision exceeded. REJECT."
  },
  
  precision_inflation: {
    detection: "Generated implies greater certainty than source",  
    rejection: "CAUGHT! Precision inflation detected. REJECT."
  },
  
  ownership_assumption: {
    detection: "Generated claims ownership not in source",
    rejection: "CAUGHT! Ownership not established. REJECT."
  }
}
```
